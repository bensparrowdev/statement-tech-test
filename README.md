### Responsive landing page with add to bag functionality

A very simple landing page for a fictional pet brand showing 1 of their products for sale.\
\
Clicking the 'Add to bag' button will open the bag with the product inside.\
\
This is a very basic model and has space to include more functionality in future, such as adding multiple products to the bag, removing products and calculating a total value.
